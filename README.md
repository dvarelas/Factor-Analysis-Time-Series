Factor Analysis using PCA on time series data

The algorithm proposed can be implemented when one wants to extract factor scores and their loadings under two different specifications of the underlying factor model.

The first model suggests that the specific factors (idiosyncratic terms) are homoscedastic; whereas the second one allows for heteroscedascity among the specific factors.

The factors are considered to be static and the preliminary extraction of the loadings is achieved using PCA on both cases. Finally the scores provided are based on the trasformation proposed by Doz, Giannone, Reichlin (2012).
